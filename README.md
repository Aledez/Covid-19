A project to see what are the covid 19 statistics in 2023

As a novice analyst, I embarked on my first project to investigate the COVID-19 statistics in 2023. The project involved extensive data collection, cleaning, and analysis to provide a comprehensive report on the pandemic's impact. Through the use of statistical techniques, I identified patterns and trends in the data and developed predictive models to aid in decision-making. The final report provided valuable insights and recommendations for policymakers and healthcare professionals to manage the pandemic's effects. Overall, the project allowed me to hone my analytical skills and provided a meaningful contribution to the public health domain.

Also, I completed my first project as part of @AlexTheAnalyst bootcamp, analyzing COVID-19 statistics in 2023. While the boot camp focused on using SQL Server, I encountered challenges when attempting to write the code for MySQL. This obstacle presented an opportunity for me to explore and discover alternative solutions, enabling me to develop coding skills in different environments. Despite the initial difficulty, I was able to complete the project successfully, utilizing MySQL to collect, clean, and analyze the data, and presenting my findings in a comprehensive report. The experience allowed me to further my knowledge and provided a valuable opportunity to develop my analytical and problem-solving skills.
